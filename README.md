I'll review the uploaded Jupyter Notebook and create a README file for your project along with a description. Let me check the contents first.

It seems there was an error while trying to open the file. I'll try a different approach to analyze the notebook content.

The notebook seems to focus on analyzing house prices using a dataset containing 81 features, with the final target being the "Property_Sale_Price." It involves typical data science steps like loading data, performing exploratory data analysis, and applying linear regression.

Here is a draft of the README file for the project:

# House Price Prediction using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model. The dataset contains 81 features such as lot size, neighborhood, year built, and more, which are used to train the model and predict the final sale price.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict house prices based on the given features. The dataset contains various numerical and categorical variables, and the project follows a standard data science workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset containing house prices and features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to understand the distribution of features, handle missing values, and visualize relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the data by encoding categorical variables, filling missing values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training:** Train an OLS regression model to predict house prices.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd house-price-prediction
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook house_price_ols_project.ipynb
```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features related to house characteristics. It can be found in the `HousePrices.csv` file.

## Results

The trained model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics. The model provides insights into which features are most influential in predicting house prices.
